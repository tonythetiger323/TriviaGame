## About this project:
TriviaGame is a game I had to make for homework, as part of the Northwestern University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, whose purpse was to demonstrate my understading of timers in JavaScript.

TriviaGame was built with HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap4, Javascript and JQuery 3.3.1.

## Summary of Gameplay:
The game starts with a start screen with a start button, once the start button is clicked a trivia question will come up and the user has 30 seconds to pick their answer. If their answe is right the get a point added to the collect variable and the next question comes up. However, she the user pick the wrong answer or the 30 seconds run out, then their incorrect variable is increased by 1.
